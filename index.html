        Dear thinkificans, we ("The Sara/h commitee") will allow apologies for those with English as
        a second language. The guilty party will still need to donate funds to the "The Sara/h commitee",
        but if they apologize and then use the right name in the next <strong>business day</strong>,
        they are forgiven and refunded. Those are the terms and conditions with working with Sarah Billy
        and Sara Doole.
      </p>

      <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>
